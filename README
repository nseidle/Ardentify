Screamer is a auto-detecting, high speed bootloader for microcontrollers. Specifically, we target the ATmega line by Atmel but the protocol and supporting programs should work for all microcontrollers.

In this repository you will find the bootloader (written in C for AVC-GCC) and an example processing app to talk to the bootloader (cross platform supported). We welcome any feedback you may have. Please post any issues to the Github page.
