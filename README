Screamer is a auto-detecting, high speed bootloader for microcontrollers. Specifically, we target the ATmega line by Atmel but the protocol and supporting programs should work for all microcontrollers.

We have also written a Processing sketch that auto-detects current Arduino boards (Uno, LilyPad, Pro Mini 8 and 16MHz) as well as some of the older boards (Duemilnove, Diecimila).

In this repository you will find the bootloader (written in C for AVC-GCC) and an example processing app to talk to the bootloader (cross platform supported). We welcome any feedback you may have. Please post any issues to the Github page.

We hope this bootloader helps beginners to identify what board they have. Some day we would love to see this feature baked into the Arduino IDE as an 'identify' button. We're tired of users getting stuck on "Which board do I click on?"
