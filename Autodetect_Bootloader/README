This is the auto-detect bootloader written for the ATmega series. To load this bootloader onto your ATmega, you will need to do the following steps:

1) Modify the various property tags within Autodetect_Bootloader.c to match your specific IC, board, voltage, frequency, etc.

2) Compile the C file using AVR-GCC (WinAVR works great for windows) for your specific target IC. Find this line in the Makefile and modify as you see fit:
MCU = atmega328

3) Load the firmware onto your target board. I use the MKII from Atmel but you can also use an Arduino to program an Arduino:

4) Start the Processing app. Click 'Identify'. You should see the board identify itself as a Screamer bootloader.

5) Time to load something! Click 'File' to load a new firmware file. If you don't know how to get to the HEX file for your sketch, hold the 'shift' key before you hit the 'play'/compile button. This will show you the raw location of your hex file (it is usually buried deep in a temp directory). Once you have located the HEX file, load it, then press download. The firmware file should load very fast and start running.

Enjoy!
